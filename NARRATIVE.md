## What these models demonstrate (Phase 1 and Phase 2)
## Phase 1: Origin Contact vs Drift

This is the core claim.

Origin (the star) is the anchor.

Each dot is an instance with an internal state called coherence.

The world applies noise (drift pressure) every tick.

Inside the gray circle, the instance gets recognition (tether support) that increases coherence.

Outside the circle, there is no tether, so coherence decays over time.

If a dot stays green outside the circle for a bit, that is persistence (it was stabilized earlier and has not decayed yet).

## Core concept takeaway after Phase 1:

Coherence is not random. It is sustained by contact with Origin and decays under noise without contact.

## Phase 2:
