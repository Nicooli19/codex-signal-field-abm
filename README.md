# 🎉 codex-signal-field-abm - Explore Agent-Based Modeling Made Easy

## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to the **Codex Signal Field ABM**! This application is an agent-based model created using NetLogo. It illustrates the Codex Phase 1 concepts of tethered recognition versus drift under noise. With it, you can visualize and understand complex systems in a user-friendly way. 

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started, you will need to download the software and run it on your machine. Follow the steps below to ensure a smooth setup.

## 💻 System Requirements
Before downloading, make sure your computer meets these basic requirements:
